Campaign-Finance-Data-Parse
===========================
Task as a research assistant in grad school. Parsed all campaign finance data since about 1990 for employees of specific 
retail companies that the prof wanted to write a paper about.

Parsing is done using the sqldf package in R (SQLite). 

Attempt 3 was succesful at making this work. "Scripts for comp lab" were for each company. Each script was run on a 
different computer. "computer lab" is the output from those scripts. 

However,since that's a decent sized file, I deleted output from comp 2 through comp 15. comp 1 has one csv file as an 
example, the rest of the csv files and folders for comp3 through comp 15 were deleted

"organize wed" is the scripts I used to clean up the data for the Weds due date. 

"wed.meeting" has the "Data for weds" final product. There was room for improvement but it was decided that wasn't 
necessary.
